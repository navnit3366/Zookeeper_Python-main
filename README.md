# Zookeeper
- I tried to create a Zookeeper program with all basic python code. I used raw string (r'''), while loop along with loop control statements to create this program.
- It has images of different animals which are created by keyboard characters (which is just amazing!)
- Features:
  - It shows images of different animals based on userinput
  - The program can be exited manually by typing exit in userinput
  - It prompts user for input that is out of range
